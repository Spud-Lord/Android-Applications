    \nDid you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?
    \n\nNo?
    \n\nI thought not. It\'s not a story the Jedi would tell you.
    \nDarth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side, he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
    \n\nHe could actually save people from death?
    \n\nThe Dark Side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural
    \n\nWhat happened to him?
    \n\nHe became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.
    \nIronic...
    \nHe could save others from death, but not himself...
    \n\nIs it possible to learn this power?
    \n\nNot from a Jedi...
